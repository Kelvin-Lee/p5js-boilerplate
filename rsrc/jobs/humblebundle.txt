Description
Position at Humble Bundle

Humble Bundle sells games, ebooks, software, and other digital content. Our mission is to support charity while providing awesome content to customers at great prices. We launched in 2010 with a single two-week Humble Indie Bundle, but we have humbly grown into a store full of games and bundles, a subscription service, a game publisher, and more. We have raised over $160 million for charity and counting.

Humble Bundle is seeking outstanding full-stack web developers to join our team. As part of our Subscription Engineering team, you'll work closely with a team of Designers, Product Managers, and other Engineers to build fantastic new features for our flagship product Humble Choice. You'll use a variety of modern technologies on the front-end (i.e. ES6 Javascript, Backbone + Marionette) and back-end (i.e. Google Cloud Platform) to deliver features that are robust, scalable, and performant. Your work will immediately impact our customer base who have helped us in raising over $160M for amazing charities like the Red Cross, Child's Play, and EFF.

This is an on-site position at our office in San Francisco.
