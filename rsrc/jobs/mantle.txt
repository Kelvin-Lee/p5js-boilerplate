Front End Software Engineer
Mantle, Inc.
-
San Francisco, CA
Who We Are:
An early-stage startup, Mantle is bringing manufacturing back to local communities. How? Through metal additive manufacturing an order of magnitude less complicated and lower cost than existing printers. Today, popular metal 3D printers cost half a million dollars or more and use complicated high-powered lasers and controlled atmospheres. At Mantle, we're taking an entirely different approach that uses proprietary materials science and machine design to make metal 3D printing easier, simpler and less expensive than previously imaginable. To put it simply, we believe our technology will fundamentally change how metal parts are made.

This is an opportunity for you to join a dedicated team of engineers and scientists passionate about manufacturing innovation. We see technical challenges as opportunities, and through teamwork we find creative solutions. Are you passionate about collaborating towards goals? Then we encourage you to apply.

The Mantle office is located in San Francisco, CA and is walking distance to BART and Caltrain. We offer a great compensation package: 401k, medical, dental and vision insurance, stock options, and commuter benefits.

Who We're Looking for:
Do you like to create Software for disruptive technology? Are you interested in working on cutting-edge machine development? We're looking for a Front-End Software Engineer to work on Intelligent, Multi-Functional Software Systems at the heart of a Metal 3D Printer. We need someone to contribute to the development of Machine UI for modeling, visualizing and analyzing of metal formation.
